# PyBer_Analysis
Create a visualization of data to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved areas, using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, MatPlotLib.

Finding from 5. 4. 1
If we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Finding from 5.4.4
There is one outlier in the urban ride count data (West Angela has the highest rider count). Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Finding from 5.4.4
From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. Why do you think there is such a big difference? By looking at the number of riders for each city, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

Finding from 5.4.4
The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively. By looking at the driver count data and fare data, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?
