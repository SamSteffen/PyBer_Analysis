# PyBer_Analysis
Create a visualization of data to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved areas, using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, MatPlotLib.

Finding from 5. 4. 1
If we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Finding from 5.4.4
There is one outlier in the urban ride count data (West Angela has the highest rider count). Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Finding from 5.4.4
From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. Why do you think there is such a big difference? By looking at the number of riders for each city, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

Finding from 5.4.4
The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively. By looking at the driver count data and fare data, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

# Challenge_Background
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Challenge_Instructions
Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

The analysis should contain the following:

# Overview of the analysis: 
- (Explain the purpose of the new analysis.)
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)

# Results: 
- Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

# Summary: 
- Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)

Deliverable 3 Requirements
